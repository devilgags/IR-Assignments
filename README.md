# IR-Assignments
Part of CSCI 572 Fall 2016 Course

It has the following Assignments 
1. Web Crawlers
2. Indexing the Web using Solr
3. Enhancing Your Search Engine

All code written is by me, except of Norvig's algorithm code or default code provided by Solr. Appropriate modifications were made to schema and xml files in Solr to achieve the target of the individual assignments.
